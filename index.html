            What is coronavirus (COVID-19)?
            </h3>
            <p>Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that cause respiratory infections. These can range from the common cold to more serious diseases.
            COVID-19 is the disease caused by a new coronavirus. It was first reported in December 2019 in Wuhan City in China.Other coronaviruses include Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS)  and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS)</p>
            <h3>
            How are coronaviruses spread?
            </h3>
            <p>
            An investigation of the COVID-19 is still ongoing but other human coronaviruses are spread through person-to-person contact. Similar to cold and flu, a person becomes sick through close contact with an infected person. The virus is spread through respiratory droplets produced by an infected person through coughing and sneezing or by touching surfaces with the virus on them.
            </p>
            <h3>
            How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?   
            </h3>
            <p>
            The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus
            and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of
            the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most
            commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more
            data become available. 
            </p>
            <h3>
            How long does the virus survive on surfaces?    
            </h3>
            <p>
            It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on
            surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies
            suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the
            COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to
            several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of
            surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).
            If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant
            to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with 
            an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid
            touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. 
            </p>
